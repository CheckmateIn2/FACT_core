quotation mix:
- view.html

ajax view:
- could you reuse most of this for the other view by moving it to an additional .html file ( {% include .. %} )?

view:
- works
- optional: optimize representation (like -rwxrwxr-x 3 dorp:dorp 2018-01-05 14:22)

code:
- line 70: Zuweisung kann weg. ConnectTo kann direkt auf das Interface geworfen werden
- in mount() exchange RuntimeError with something more specific. I don't know what possibly inherits from RuntimeError
- line 94: Two options: at least use analysis_filter with get_object, better even define own little DbInterface like e.g. similar_files analysis plugin does
- _parent_has_file_system_metadata(): What happens if parent is not yet stored. Then this is always false, no?
- lines 101 - 105 are kind of an "evil hack" --> Maybe make three globals: FS_MIMES = [...], TAR_MIMES = [...], ALL_MIMES = FS_MIMES + TAR_MIMES
- line 110: isn't the distinction needless. I always mount ext4 with "-t ext4"
- line 119: for file_name in file_names
- line 127: why b64 ?
- line 171: looks like black magic to me. But who cares if it works
- line 181: consider stat.filemode(stats.st_mode)
- line 144: In the current form the if seems redundant. As of now, only these three strings can appear here, no?
- line 176: see above

routes:
- line 59: why use AnalysisPlugin.NAME here and nowhere else?
- lines 19, 23: see above. use filter or Interface defined in plugin (or __init__.py ??)
- line 28: parameter uid is useless - can be found in fo
- line 30: Maybe that's the way to do it. Maybe it's return None. Don't know what's the consensus ..
- lines 32 - 37: no comment ^^
- <<< Correction >>> I see AnalysisPlugin.NAME is used here as well. But it seems you only import it for the sake of naming. Maybe that's a bit much

test_plugin:
- > 7s :'(
- line 56: Double undescores ยง$%&
- note: i won't check if the tests make sense. I.e. I'm not going to unpack the test archives and mark the ids, modes etc.
- after line 162: result = None for good measure
- line 180: see note about black magic
- line 203: isn't TEST_FW2 a .7z which in turn is not in the MIME list?
- line 263: No check that the result differs from first test case
- line 268: more semantic. why is len(.keys) == 1 the right thing

test_routes:
- I'd like it if the setup / teardown would be made accessible for all plugins -> Maybe we move it to _core
- line ..: double underscore action
- slight note: you control the results ( {'result': 'value'} ) but you never test for them
- line 76: Please refactor test. lines 80 - 82 seem super redundant and line 83 seems misplaced or useless

Note on testing with assert: use the ", <message_string>" syntax to give the test semantic. this is the equivalent for the last parameter in the self.assertEqual and other unittest.TestCase methods
